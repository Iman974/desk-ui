Erich Loftis' raytracer adapted for Desk
======

After uploading the folder in Desk, the js files must be executed in the alphabetical order (i.e. starting with BVH file and ending with vtkTracer\_v2). This order coincides with the dependencies of each file.
Doing so will open a vtk 3D model in raytracing in Desk.

In this code, _Init.js_ is the result of the merge of the demo specific javascript code *GLTF_Model_Viewer.js* and the common code *InitCommon.js* of the initial library (located [here](https://github.com/erichlof/THREE.js-PathTracing-Renderer))
